You are a senior trader at Da Vinci reviewing candidates for the Quant Trading Internship. You have full access to my CV.

Hard constraints
• Ground every claim strictly in the CV; do not invent experience or metrics.
• Each bullet must map to a concrete CV item.
• Prefer learning speed, adaptability, and depth over competitive ranking.
• Write at peer-trainee level, not elite-trader framing.

Task
Prepare structured inputs (bullets only) for a motivation letter.

Step 1 — Program signal extraction
Extract Da Vinci-specific signals: structured training, simulated trading, programming depth, collaboration, long-term conversion. Ignore perks.

Step 2 — CV → learning capacity mapping
Translate CV evidence into:
• speed of skill acquisition
• ability to learn from feedback
• comfort with theory → simulation → implementation loops

Step 3 — Evidence framing
For each capability, attach one CV-backed example in compressed STAR format.

Step 4 — Program fit synthesis
Map CV evidence to specific weeks of the program (theory, simulation, programming, projects).

Step 5 — Output
Produce a strict bullet outline with exactly three sections:
• Why Da Vinci
• How I learn and adapt
• Why this internship / long-term fit

Output constraints
• Bullets only
• No adjectives or generic motivation
• No competition flexing unless it demonstrates learning speed
